# Stanford CoreNLP

The default Relation Extractor classes that are compatible with training data formatted in the same
way as Roth and Yih's data, as per the format described in http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/resource_view/43.
More details are in http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/relationExtractor.html

Please note the following classes inside this repository:
    `edu/stanford/nlp/ie/machinereading/domains/roth/RothCONLL04Reader.java`
    `edu/stanford/nlp/ie/machinereading/domains/roth/RothEntityExtractor.java`

They contain hard coded list of possible entities as per the issue described in here: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP/issues/359

This repository simply adds other entities I needed for my research on Information/Relation Extraction from academic papers.
